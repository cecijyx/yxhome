<h1>Research Statement</h1>
<p><cite>I didn't fail the test. I just found 100 ways to do it wrong - Benjamin Franklin</cite>

Benjamin Franklin has always been an inspiration to me and his philosophy of life has 
influenced my life journals over the past 10 years.

He was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, freemason,
postmaster, scientist, inventor, humorist, civic activist, statesman, and
diplomat.

His &ldquo;never say die&rdquo; and &ldquo;learning from mistake&rdquo; attitudes have shaped him to be
a better man in every phase of his life, contributing greatly to his society.

I have learned from him to step outside my comfort zone and to take the risks in
life that seem worth taking.

During my time in the graduate school, my research focuses on ultra-low
voltage and energy efficient integrated circuit design.

After my graduation, I have decided to take a leap of faith to join GLOBALFOUNDRIES as a
design-for-manufacturability software engineer.

The job has provided me with multiple opportunities to understand systematic and 
random defects manufacturing issue related to the quality of layout design.

Over the duration of four years, I have involved in the development of several EDA
softwares which have successfully differentiated GLOBALFOUNDRIES from her
competitors.  
</p>
<h2>Next phase</h2>
<p>
Moving onto the next chapter in my life, I wish to be in a place, where I can learn,
influence, cultivate a strong multi-disciplinary research team that can help me
to incubate my elegant ideas, formulate it succinctly and passionately strive to 
reach the goal with scientific integrity.

With my experience in both architecture and circuits, I feel well-placed to recognize how to
exploit new technologies for ever more efficient, reliable and high-performance integrated 
circuit design.

Circuit design has deeply rooted in my heart since I took up this discipline a
decade ago.

It  is an art, a science, a rare skill.

An art practiced by skilled engineers who possess the creativity and expertise 
to construct high performance circuits from individual transistors and passive components.

I believe that I have the necessary disciplinary background and appropriate range of skills, expertise, experience and knowledge base to conduct the proposed research effectively within the available resources.

<p>In the recent years, wearable sensors are becoming increasingly important 
in monitoring and delivery of healthcare interventions. 

It is important to investigate and identify challenges and critical issues related to the 
use of wearable sensors in healthcare including; reliability, efficiency, 
variability, cost effectiveness, energy usage, user interface, quality of 
medical data, and security and privacy. 

I will elaborate on the various research opportunities in the subsequent paragraphs.

<h3>1) Low power, low voltage analog and digital integrated circuit sensor design</h3>
<p>
As CMOS technologies scale to smaller nodes, digital designs enjoy obvious benefits
in terms of higher speed and lower power consumption. However, scaling doesn¡¦t
happen so readily or cleanly with analog designs. 

Analog circuits frequently make use of &ldquo;digital assistance&rdquo;, which allows 
simplification of the critical analog circuits that don't scale easily. 

Digitally-assisted analog techniques, such as calibration, allow for considerable 
relaxation of the analog performance, which can be used for minimizing
both area and power consumption. 

These circuit techniques allow us to design near-threshold voltage circuit for
our wearable sensors.
</p>
<h3>2) Energy harvesting circuit</h3>
<p>
Enabling the wearable senors, with limited or no battery, to perform biosignal acquisition
on harvested energy is another promising research direction.	

I plan to continue research on reconfigurable circuit to allow adaptive signal
acquisition under energy-limited condition.
</p>
<h3>3) Vital signs signal processing and classification</h3>
<p>
To improve the energy efficient of our wearable sensors, based on past
research works, it is important to minimize the data for transmission.

As such, we need to explore and develop energy-efficient data compression
algorithms and vital signs abnormality detection.

On-chip machine learning is one of my key focus that I would like to investigate 
and demonstrate ¡§patient-specific¡¨ disease detection/suppression. 

This allows to transmit critical information during abnormality situation.

Even through research on machine learnings has been on-going for the past
years, it is still far away from integrating into wearable sensors.

My prior experience in circuit design and software programming in neural networks
helped me to identify the missing link and propose an energy-efficient
classification engine.
</p>
<h3>4) Hardware system and information security research </h3>
<p>
Till date, most of the wearable sensors have yet to address some critical
issues and challenges related to security and privacy of data/information.

In order to protect our hardware sensors and our users&rsquo; vital signs
information, we need to leverage on manufacturing knowledge to obfuscate our 
circuit and layout.

We also need to develop energy-efficient circuit implementation of data
encryption algorithm to improve the security and privacy of data.
</p>
<h3>5) Clinical Trials</h3>
<p>
In a number of scenarios user-friendliness, convenience and effectiveness 
of wearable systems have been acknowledged by both patients as well as 
healthcare providers. 

It requires advanced concepts and techniques from multidisciplinary fields 
of electrical engineering, computer science, biomedical engineering and medicine 
which benefit the innovations of these fields towards healthcare systems. 

In order for our research works become useful healthcare product, we need to
consistently evaluate and perform clinical trials with our prototype.

The experiences will be useful for us to refine and validate our products.
